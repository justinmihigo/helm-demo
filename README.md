### Deep Dive into helm charts
- This repo includes a deep dive into helm charts, in the demo I was trying to bootstrap an nginx deployment with mysql as a dependency.
### Our goal
- My goal was to learn how to create helm charts and create release and rollback at least once and learn the pros and cons of using sub charts.
